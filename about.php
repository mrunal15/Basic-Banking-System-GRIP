                <p>GRIP Bank Ltd., today, is operating as a full service universal bank that serves the customers from
                    all segments.<BR>


                    GRIP Bank Ltd. has inherited a rich legacy from its predecessor entity - Industrial Development Bank
                    of India – which was an apex Development Financial Institution (DFI) in the realm of industry from
                    July 1, 1964 to September 30, 2004. As a DFI, the erstwhile IDBI stretched its canvas beyond mere
                    project financing to cover an array of services that contributed towards balanced geographical
                    spread of industries, development of identified backward areas, emergence of a new spirit of
                    enterprise and evolution of a deep and vibrant capital market.<BR>


                    On October 1, 2004, the erstwhile GRIP was converted into a banking company – GRIP Ltd. - to
                    undertake the entire gamut of banking activities while continuing to play its secular DFI role.
                    Desirous of fuelling its business growth, IDBI Ltd. merged its subsidiaries - the erstwhile GRIP
                    Bank, GRIP Home Finance Ltd., GRIP Gilts, the erstwhile United Western Bank Ltd., with itself over a
                    period of time. GRIP Ltd. also changed its name to GRIP Bank Ltd. to reflect its widened business
                    functions.<BR>


                    As an universal bank, GRIP Bank Ltd. touches the lives of millions of Indians through a wide array
                    of banking products and services. Besides, the Bank has an established presence in associated
                    financial sector businesses including capital market, investment banking and mutual fund business.
                    The Bank’s very business philosophy is characterised by the commitment to provide relevant financial
                    solutions, ensure maximum customer convenience through easy access to branches and ATMs as well as
                    digital offerings and excellence in customer service.<BR>


                    Going forward, GRIP Bank is strongly committed to work towards emerging as ‘most preferred and
                    trusted bank enhancing value for all stakeholders’.</p>
